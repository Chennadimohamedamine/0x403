A comprehensive Python tool designed for security researchers, penetration testers, and bug bounty hunters to test various HTTP 403 Forbidden bypass techniques.

## üöÄ Features

### HTTP Method Testing
- Tests multiple HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, HEAD, PATCH, TRACE, CONNECT
- Identifies methods that bypass access restrictions

### Header-Based Bypasses
- **IP Spoofing Headers**: X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP, X-Originating-IP, X-Remote-IP
- **Protocol Headers**: X-Forwarded-Proto, X-Forwarded-Protocol, X-Forwarded-Ssl
- **User-Agent Variations**: Googlebot, mobile browsers, custom agents
- **Custom Authorization Headers**: X-Custom-IP-Authorization and more

### URL Path Manipulations
- Trailing slash variations (`/admin` vs `/admin/`)
- Case sensitivity tests (`/Admin`, `/ADMIN`)
- URL encoding (single and double encoding)
- Path traversal attempts (`/./admin`, `/../admin`)
- Unicode character substitution
- HTTP Parameter Pollution

### Protocol & Port Testing
- HTTP/HTTPS protocol switching
- Common port variations (80, 443, 8080, 8443, etc.)

### Combined Techniques
- Tests combinations of headers + URL variations
- Method + header combinations for maximum coverage

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install requests colorama
```

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/0x403.git
cd 0x403
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python 0x403.py https://target.com/admin
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
# Custom delay between requests (default: 0.5 seconds)
python 0x403.py https://target.com/admin --delay 1.0

# Custom timeout (default: 10 seconds)
python 0x403.py https://target.com/admin --timeout 15

# Combined options
python 0x403.py https://target.com/admin --delay 0.8 --timeout 20
```

### Example Output
```

## üîß Technical Details

### Bypass Techniques Implemented

1. **HTTP Method Bypass**
   - Some applications only restrict GET requests
   - Tests all common HTTP methods

2. **IP-based Header Bypass**
   - Spoofs client IP using various headers
   - Useful when IP-based access control is implemented

3. **Protocol Manipulation**
   - Tests HTTP vs HTTPS access
   - Some applications have different rules for different protocols

4. **Path Normalization Issues**
   - Exploits how web servers handle path normalization
   - URL encoding and case sensitivity variations

5. **Combined Attack Vectors**
   - Real-world scenarios often require multiple techniques
   - Tests logical combinations of bypass methods

## ‚ö° Performance Features

- **Configurable Delays**: Prevent overwhelming target servers
- **Timeout Controls**: Handle slow responses gracefully
- **Session Management**: Efficient connection reuse
- **Colored Output**: Easy-to-read results with status indicators
- **Detailed Reporting**: Comprehensive summary of successful bypasses

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Bug Bounty Hunting**: Identify access control vulnerabilities
- **Penetration Testing**: Assess application security controls
- **Security Research**: Study HTTP 403 bypass techniques
- **DevSecOps**: Test your own applications for access control issues

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Disclaimer

**üö® IMPORTANT: For Authorized Testing Only**

This tool is designed for:
- Systems you own
- Authorized penetration testing engagements
- Bug bounty programs with explicit permission
- Educational purposes in controlled environments

**Unauthorized testing may be illegal in your jurisdiction. Always ensure you have proper authorization before testing any system.**
